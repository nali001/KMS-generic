Necessity who is the mother of invention  Plato   Welcome to my GitHub repository on Using Predictive Analytics model to diagnose breast cancer    Objective The repository is a learning exercise to  Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset  Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set  Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process   The analysis is divided into four sections saved in juypter notebooks in this repository 1 Identifying the problem  and Data Sources 2 Exploratory Data Analysis 3 PreProcessing the Data 4 Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is  malignant or Benign   Notebook 1httpsgithubcomShiroJeanBreastcancerriskpredictionblobmasterNB1IdentifyProblem2BDataCleanipynb Identifying the problem and Getting data Notebook goalIdentify the types of information contained in our data set In this notebook I used Python modules to import external data sets for the purpose of getting to knowfamiliarize myself with the data to get a good grasp of the data and think about how to handle the data in different ways  Notebook 2httpsgithubcomShiroJeanBreastcancerriskpredictionblobmasterNB2ExploratoryDataAnalysisipynb Exploratory Data Analysis Notebook goal Explore the variables to assess how they relate to the response variable  In this notebook I am getting familiar with the data using data exploration and visualization techniques using python libraries Pandas matplotlib seaborn Familiarity with the data is important which will provide useful knowledge for data preprocessing  Notebook 3httpsgithubcomShiroJeanBreastcancerriskpredictionblobmasterNB3DataPreprocesingipynb PreProcessing the data Notebook goalFind the most predictive features of the data and filter it so it will enhance the predictive power of the analytics model In this notebook I use feature selection to reduce highdimension data feature extraction and transformation for dimensionality reduction This is essential in preparing the data before predictive models are developed  Notebook 4httpsgithubcomShiroJeanBreastcancerriskpredictionblobmasterNB4PredictiveModelUsingSVMipynb Predictive model using Support Vector Machine svm Notebook goal Construct predictive models to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor  In this notebook I construct a predictive model using SVM machine learning algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a breast tumor The diagnosis of a breast tumor is a binary variable benign or malignant I also evaluate the model using confusion matrix the receiver operating curves ROC which are essential in assessing and interpreting the fitted model   Notebook 5httpsgithubcomShiroJeanBreastcancerriskpredictionblobmasterNB520OptimizingSVMClassifieripynb Optimizing the  Support Vector Classifier Notebook goal Construct predictive models to predict the

desempea un papel importante en el diagnstico asistido por computadora En el presente estudio nos centramos en la segmentacin de tumores cerebrales de tipo meningioma en imgenes de resonancia magntica MRI potenciadas en T1 El data set usado cuenta con 708 imgenes adquiridas de una basa de datos abierta del hospital general Tianjing Medical University de China entre los aos 2005 a 2010 Las imgenes tienen una resolucin en el plano de 512  512 El borde del tumor fue delineado manualmente por tres radilogos experimentados generando las mscaras de los tumores Dentro del dataset nombrado como l1 se encuentran subcarpetas nombradas mediante nmeros que indican la pertenencia a un paciente especifico A su vez esta contiene dos carpetas imagen y mask La carpeta imagen contiene la imagen de resonancia magntica estructural con extensin bmp en cuanto a la carpeta mask contiene la imagen binaria de la mscara que delimita el tumor  El proceso se llev a cabo mediante la siguiente secuencia de trabajo  1 Se busco un dataset con imgenes de resonancia magnetica el dataset seleccionado fue httpsfigsharecomarticlesbraintumordataset15124271  2 El dataset contena la informacin en archivos mat fue necesario separar la informacin de estos archivos y guardarla en carpetas separadas  3 Se uso el algoritmo ExtraerimagenmascaraV2ipynb que se encuentra en este repositorio El algoritmo adems de extraer la imagen y su correspondiente mascara se encarga de dividir la informacin en train y test con una proporcin de 70 para train y 30 para test de manera aleatoria   4 El algoritmo mencionado en el punto 3 presento problemas de kernel al ejecutarse en una mquina virtual se recomienda dividir las imgenes en tandas de 400 imgenes por cada proceso de extraccin o ejecutar el cdigo directamente sobre una computadora  5 Despus de terminar la ejecucin de este cdigo se obtienen tres carpetas en el caso de segmentacin de tumores de tipo meningioma corresponder a la carpeta l1 Esta carpeta se comparti como dataset de anlisis y se carga de manera automtica en el notebook u3Proyecto  6 El notebook U3Proyecto es el algoritmo encargado de la segmentacin de los tumores En el se describe de manera detallada el proceso que se llev a cabo para ejecutar la tarea de segmentacin  7 El porcentaje de concordancia promedio obtenido en las 212 imgenes de test fue de 77 Se considera que este promedio es representativo para ser aceptado como un algoritmo de segmentacin de apoyo para la deteccin de cncer de tipo meningioma", "html_url":

lets take what youve learned about Python Matplotlib and apply it to a realworld situation and dataset  LaboratoryImagesLaboratoryjpg  While your data companions rushed off to jobs in finance and government you remained adamant that science was the way for you Staying true to your mission youve joined Pymaceuticals Inc a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego Pymaceuticals specializes in anticancer pharmaceuticals In its most recent efforts it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma SCC a commonly occurring form of skin cancer  As a senior data analyst at the company youve been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study In this study 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens Over the course of 45 days tumor development was observed and measured The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals drug of interest Capomulin versus the other treatment regimens You have been tasked by the executive team to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study The executive team also has asked for a toplevel summary of the study results   Instructions  Your tasks are to do the following   Before beginning the analysis check the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID   Use the cleaned data for the remaining steps   Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean median variance standard deviation and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen   Generate a bar plot using both Pandass DataFrameplot and Matplotlibs pyplot that shows  the number of total mice for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study     NOTE These plots should look identical   Generate a pie plot using both Pandass DataFrameplot and Matplotlibs pyplot that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study     NOTE These plots should look identical   Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens Capomulin Ramicane Infubinol and Ceftamin Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens   Using Matplotlib generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style    Hint All four box plots should be within the same figure Use this Matplotlib documentation pagehttpsmatplotliborggallerypyplotsboxplotdemopyplothtmlsphxglrgallerypyplotsboxplotdemopyplotpy for help with changing the style of the outliers   Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of time point versus tumor volume for that mouse   Generate a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen   Calculate the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment Plot the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot   Look across all previously generated figures and tables and write at least three observations or inferences that can be made from the data Include these observations at the top of notebook  Here are some final considerations   You must use proper labeling of your plots to include properties such as plot titles axis labels legend labels xaxis and yaxis limits etc   See the starter workbookPymaceuticalspymaceuticalsstarteripynb for help on what modules to import and expected format of the notebook   Hints and Considerations   Be warned These are very challenging tasks Be patient with yourself as you trudge through these problems They will take time and there is no shame in fumbling along the way Data visualization is equal parts exploration equal parts resolution   You have been provided a starter notebook Use the code comments as a reminder of steps to follow as you complete the assignment   Dont get bogged down in small details Always focus on the big picture If you cant figure out how to get a label to show up correctly come back to it Focus on getting the core skeleton of your notebook complete You can always revisit old problems   While you are trying to complete this assignment feel encouraged to constantly refer to Stack Overflow and the Pandas documentation These are needed tools in every data analysts tool belt   Remember there are many ways to approach a data problem The key is to break up your task into micro tasks Try answering questions like     How does my DataFrame need to be structured for me to have the right xaxis and yaxis     How do I build a basic scatter plot     How do I add a label to that scatter plot     Where would the labels for that scatter plot come from    Again dont let the magnitude of a programming task scare you off Ultimately every programming problem boils down to a handful of bitesized tasks   Get help when you need it There is never any shame in asking But as always ask a specific question Youll never get
